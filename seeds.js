  description: "I am a keen mountaineer, and spent my summer holidays bagging a few munros. I had reached the summit in the earliy afternoon. After a pause for a cup of tea from my thermos, I started to hurry down, as the weather was changing and a mist started to come in, when I began to think I heard something else than merely the noise of my own footsteps. Every few steps I took I heard a crunch, then another crunch as if someone was walking after me but taking steps three or four times the length of my own. I said to myself 'this is all nonsense'. I listened and heard it again but could see nothing in the mist . As I walked on and the eerie crunch, crunch sounded behind me I was seized with terror and took to my heels, staggering blindly among the boulders for four or five miles nearly down to Rothiemurchus Forest. Whatever you make of it I do not know, but there is something very strange about the top of Ben MacDhui and will not go back there again by myself I know.",

  description: "I am an SPT employee, but I can't give you any more details, in case I lose my job. I was carrying out some routine maintenance of the outer tunnel near West Street station, when I saw something terrible. I had turned around, and this kid appeared out of the shadows further down the tunnel, and at first I thought it was a ned playing silly games. I shouted out asking what the hell he was doing down there, when it turned around, I realised something was wrong with his face, as it was distorted and animal like. He appeared to be gnawing on something, it looked like raw meat. As I stepped back in horror, he disappeared. I don't know what I saw, and I can't tell anyone at work, as they'd all think I'd lost my marbles. ",

We decide to take some pictures on our polaroid, and while it started developing, we see a figure peering out the window at us during the time of shooting. I know it's not massively clear on this picture, but we are 100% sure it was a zombie, the pale complexion and the bloodthirst in the individual's eyes still send chills up my spine...",

So-called experts came by and said we were just playing tricks on them but we were only girls at the time. One of the police officers believed us but they all ignored him. To this day I still feel the presence of the poltergeist as if they are just watching and waiting to strike again.",

On the second night of the show, I saw him. He was about 4ft tall and wearing a red scarf and had muddy clothes on, like a chimney sweep. He was smiling so I guess he was enjoying the show at least. I must have been pretty good! Spooky though.. that's the last year I'm doing this panto!",
